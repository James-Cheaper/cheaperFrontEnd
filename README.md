## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. This is primarily for testing the popup UI locally.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed as a Chrome extension!

### How to Use as a Chrome Extension

1. Build the project using `npm run build`.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in your Chrome browser.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `build` folder.
5. The extension will now appear in the Chrome toolbar.
